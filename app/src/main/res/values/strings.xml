Accidents, kidnapping, sudden health issues etc. are some of the issues faced by all people. Especially, women and children are facing several threats to their safety. Every day we hear news of crimes against women at home, offices, streets etc. In the past few years, the safety of women in India has been down because of some continuous and terrible crimes against women.
